Here is the problem statement write detailed documentation for the same. Capture Functional requirements, Non functional requirements, Solution, HLD and LLD LLD should consist of models, datastore, data flows Design a leaderboard service which has 2 core capabilities 1. Fetch top N users 2. Update current Rank of given user This service needs to be built as a platform so that it can be used by different pods in the company. each pod can host multiple leaderboards. Each pod is expected to emit an event reflecting an update to the user score, which needs to be consumed asynchronously through kafka and transformed to a common schema understood by the leaderboard service. For persistence we will use sql to host 2 tables, 1. Leaderboard table (leaderboardId, createdAt, createdBy, podId, UUID, startTime, endTime, status) 2. User table (userId, leaderboardId, score, timestamp) In order to update the score efficiently and get top N users we will use redis where we will maintain a sorted set for each leaderboard.

Create a README.md file for this documentation
