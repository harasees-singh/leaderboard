need fixing of some things

in FR1, if 2 users have the same score they need to be ranked based on timestamp, earliest timestamp gets the higher rank. 

in FR2, we need to take in UUID and not leaderboardId, leaderboardId is a generated id and it need not be exposed to clients. you can take UUID in request body of the create leaderboard api. 

remove FR5

in NFRs 

can you justify these numbers for latency, throughput and response time ?

justify scalability and availability as well

also create data flow diagrams instead of just showing flow thorugh arrows

Dont need architecture components
remove additional considerations, keep failure scenarios and mitigation for now
remove future enchancements and conclusion
