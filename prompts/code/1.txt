go through the documentation and implement the leaderboard platform in java using maven as the build tool. 

Here is the scope of features that you need to build

1. implement the update score api
2. implement the Top N retrieval api

code an api layer which receives request, a service layer which houses the business logic and a repository layer which interacts with persistent storage (you can use json files instead of an actual db) and redis (use a docker container for redis)

make sure code is clean, modular, extensible, maintainable and testable. 

write unit test cases to make sure all core features are working
you can use in memory mocks for redis and persistent storage for unit tests

make sure relevant error messages are propagated. Consider all corner cases and failure scenrios and include relevant defensive checks wherever applicable.
for retrying writes to redis you can write to a queue to periodically retry.

maintain an excellent directory structure
